# Typhoon_Master

This repository is the official source code for my master graduation thesis which English name is **Research on Typhoon Movement and Intensity Forecasting Based on Deep Learning Method** and Chinese name is **《基于深度学习的台风路径与强度预测方法研究》**. The original paper has been published on CNKI [link](https://kns.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CMFD&dbname=CMFD202101&filename=1020396103.nh&uniplatform=NZKPT&v=Gxr%25mmd2F5KbrxH0arAOtM8YZhrTH6OwZ%25mmd2FiCvi%25mmd2Frk1WftrmbgYT8MN7u%25mmd2FyeTQFBFyL%25mmd2BSP). Many thank to my supervisor Prof. Yunming Ye, Prof. Xutao Li, and classmates that ever help me for this research.
